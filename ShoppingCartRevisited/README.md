* Written entirely from scratch with JUnit tests first and filled-in the Java codes to pass the tests (TDD)
* Tests are fairly extensive however negative tests are minimal (to be improve upon as required)

## System Requirements

* Java 8
* Eclipse
* Maven

## Running Test Scenarios Instructions

1. Pull the code from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/joeysindayen/shoppingcartrevisited)
2. Run Maven clean and install
3. Run the JUnit test class ShoppingCartScenarioTest to verify fulfillment of the 4 scenarios as listed in the exercise.  All scenarios are expected to pass with no failures.
